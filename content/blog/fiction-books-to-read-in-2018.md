I've always enjoyed buying new books, but I never seemed to read them at the
same rate. When my wife and I moved to London, we had to donate a bunch of books
that we had in our bookcase and that made me very sad. Not because of the
donation, but because most of the books there weren't read. Such a waste.

To avoid similar situations, we put up a plan to read more. As part of this
plan, I defined a list of books I'd like to read in 2018. It doesn't necessarily
mean that these are the only books I'm going to read, nor that I'm going to read
all of them. My goal is to use this list as a guide, and as a reminder for next
year.

I aimed for the list to contain a good mix of authors and themes, ranging from
sci-fi and fantasy, dystopian worlds, classic literature and some books that I
want to re-read. I'll publish a similar list containing non-fiction books, and
another one with comics. For the books I really end up enjoying, I plan to write
up a small review about it.

Without further due, here's my list:
